```python
def arg_names(args):
	return list(args.keys())
```

The following functions have problems with the definition of their arguments. They either:

- Forget to document some of the function arguments, or
- Document things that are not function arguments

```
SHOW project name filetype filename arg_names(args) documented(comment)
COND arg_doc_problems(args,comment)
```

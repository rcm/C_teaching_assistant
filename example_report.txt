# List of problematic functions

These functions are too complex and should be rewritten:

```
SHOW project name cyclomatic_complexity maintainability_index
COND cyclomatic_complexity > 10 or maintainability_index < 80
SORT project -maintainability_index cyclomatic_complexity name
COLOR cyclomatic_complexity : scale_lower(0,50)(cyclomatic_complexity);
                maintainability_index : scale_upper(0,100)(maintainability_index)
```

# Bad documentation

These functions have a *@return* keyword for *void* functions:

```
SHOW name comment
COND comment and return == 'void' and '@returns' in comment
```

The following functions have problems with the definition of their arguments. They either:

- Forget to document some of the function arguments, or
- Document things that are not function arguments

```
SHOW name filetype filename args documented(comment)
COND arg_doc_problems(args,comment)
```
